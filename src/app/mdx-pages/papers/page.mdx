- The authors use Rank Order Coding, where neurons that fire earlier encode more salient features of the input.
- A spike wave initiates in the retina and propagates feedforward through a hierarchical network, with each layer re-encoding saliency based on feature complexity.
- Shunting inhibition ensures that downstream neurons are sensitive to the order of incoming spikes, enabling decoding of temporal patterns.
- Attention is modeled as a temporal bias—by lowering thresholds or raising membrane potentials, certain neurons are made to fire earlier, boosting the perceived saliency of attended features.
- They show that this system can detect and classify faces in natural images with remarkable speed and efficiency, matching the temporal constraints of biological visual processing.

- Traditional view: Trial-to-trial variability in evoked cortical responses is random noise, and by averaging over many neurons (i.e., at the population level), the true "signal" emerges.
- What they show: That variability does not disappear at the population level. In fact, optical imaging and LFPs — which reflect large-scale synaptic activity — still show strong trial-to-trial variability.
- This rules out the idea that the variability is just noise. Instead, it's a result of structured, ongoing activity in the network, even in the absence of stimuli.
- They propose a simple linear model:
  Single-trial response=Average (reproducible) response+Initial (ongoing) activity
  Single-trial response=Average (reproducible) response+Initial (ongoing) activity
- The initial state (pre-stimulus activity pattern) can predict how the cortex will respond to the same stimulus on that trial.
- This works remarkably well — especially in the first ~50 ms after the stimulus — and shows that the network "state" shapes perception.
- So, the "noise" isn't noise — it's meaningful ongoing dynamics that influence stimulus processing and possibly encode context, attention, or behavioral state.
