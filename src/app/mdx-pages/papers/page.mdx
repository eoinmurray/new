# Van Rullen & Thorpe

- The authors use Rank Order Coding, where neurons that fire earlier encode more salient features of the input.
- A spike wave initiates in the retina and propagates feedforward through a hierarchical network, with each layer re-encoding saliency based on feature complexity.
- Shunting inhibition ensures that downstream neurons are sensitive to the order of incoming spikes, enabling decoding of temporal patterns.
- Attention is modeled as a temporal biasâ€”by lowering thresholds or raising membrane potentials, certain neurons are made to fire earlier, boosting the perceived saliency of attended features.
- They show that this system can detect and classify faces in natural images with remarkable speed and efficiency, matching the temporal constraints of biological visual processing.
